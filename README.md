# Reddit Comments: Sentiment Analysis

## 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Reddit comments, specifically comparing discussions about DublinBikes and BlueBikes Boston. By leveraging the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library, data was collected, processed, and analyzed to gain insights into the sentiment and subjectivity of the comments.

## 2. Data Collection

### 2.1 Data Source

Data was sourced from Reddit through an API by developing a script to scrape comments. The PRAW library was used to authenticate the Reddit API securely by storing credentials in a `.env` file.

### 2.2 Data Extraction

Two files were generated by searching for relevant submissions and extracting comments, which were saved into JSON files (`dublin_comments.json` and `boston_comments.json`). These files were later converted into pandas DataFrames for analysis.

### 2.3 Licensing

The data is permitted for use under the Reddit API's terms, allowing non-commercial use.

## 3. Data Processing and Inspection

### 3.1 DublinBikes Comments

Preprocessing involved dropping irrelevant columns, leaving a single column (`comment_body`) containing the comments. Text was then cleaned by removing punctuation, stop words, frequent and rare words, and converting all text to lowercase using the NLTK and contractions libraries.

### 3.2 BlueBikes Boston Comments

The same preprocessing steps were applied as in the DublinBikes dataset.

## 4. Feature Engineering/Extraction

### 4.1 Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis was conducted using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model through `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` from `nltk.sentiment`. A `comment_score` column was created based on polarity, classifying comments as ‘negative’, ‘neutral’, or ‘positive’.

### 4.2 Subjectivity Analysis

Subjectivity was evaluated using the TextBlob library, which is widely used for its practicality in assessing and scoring subjectivity.

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization

### 5.1 Word Count Distribution

Both datasets show a right-skewed distribution, with most comments being shorter than 50 words.

### 5.2 Polarity Distribution

The majority of comments have polarity values between -0.025 and 0.25, indicating neutrality. The BlueBikes Boston dataset shows a slight tendency towards positive sentiment.

### 5.3 Subjectivity Distribution

Most comments are close to 0 in subjectivity, suggesting they are more objective and fact-based.

### 5.4 Comment Score Distribution

- **DublinBikes**: Positive and negative scores are similar, with neutral scores being slightly lower.
- **BlueBikes Boston**: Positive scores are significantly higher than both negative and neutral scores.

### 5.5 Correlation Between Variables

- **DublinBikes**: No strong correlations were found between word count, polarity, and subjectivity.
- **BlueBikes Boston**: Weak positive correlations were observed, suggesting longer comments tend to be slightly more positive and subjective.

## 6. Statistical Insights

### 6.1 Descriptive Statistics

- **DublinBikes**: Comments are relatively short, with neutral polarity and a mix of objective and subjective comments.
- **BlueBikes Boston**: Comments show a higher standard deviation in word count, with a slight tendency towards positive sentiment and objectivity.
